# Resource Control

This section allows you to control how much of your resources will be consumed by KS automations.

The value you set for **Stock** determines the amount of the resource that KS will never touch. The only reason to set this value to anything but `0`, is for you to manually do something. The stocked amount of the resource will be entirely unavailable to KS.

The **Consume** rate defines how much of an available resource should be made available to automation as a percentage. The usefulness of this value is debateable.
