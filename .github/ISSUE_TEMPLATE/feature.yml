        Note that new features are currently _rarely_ considered to be implemented
        any time soon.

        Right now, the focus is on fixing bugs, and filling gaps in functionality. If you feel
        like your idea fits better into one of those categories, consider filing a **bug** or
        an **enhancement** instead.
